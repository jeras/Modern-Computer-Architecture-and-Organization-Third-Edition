# Chapter 1, Exercise 1

Using your favorite programming language, develop a simulation of a single-digit decimal adder that operates in the same manner as in Babbage’s Analytical Engine. First, prompt the user for two digits in the range 0-9: the addend and the accumulator. Display the addend, the accumulator, and the carry, which is initially zero. Perform a series of cycles as follows:

a.	If the addend is 0, display the values of the addend, accumulator, and carry, and terminate the program.

b.	Decrement the addend by 1 and increment the accumulator by 1.

c.	If the accumulator increments from 9 to 0, increment the carry.

d.	Go back to _step a_.

Test your code with these sums: 0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+2, 5+5, 9+1, and 9+9.


# Answer
See the Python file [Ex__1_single_digit_adder.py](src/Ex__1_single_digit_adder.py) for the adder code.

See the file [Ex__1_test_single_digit_adder.py](src/Ex__1_test_single_digit_adder.py) for the test code.

To execute the tests, assuming **Python** is installed and is in your path, execute the command `python Ex__1_test_single_digit_adder.py`

This is the output of a test run:
```
C:\>python Ex__1_test_single_digit_adder.py
