# Chapter 1, Exercise 2

Create arrays of 40 decimal digits each for the addend, accumulator, and carry. Prompt the user for two decimal integers of up to 40 digits. Perform the addition digit by digit using the cycles defined in [Exercise 1](Ex__1_single_digit_adder.md) and collect the carry output from each digit position in the carry array. After the cycles are complete, insert carries and, where necessary, ripple them across digits to complete the addition operation. Display the results after each cycle and at the end. Test with the sums in [Exercise 1](Ex__1_single_digit_adder.md) and with the sums 99+1, 999999+1, 49+50, and 50+50.

# Answer
See the Python file [Ex__2_40_digit_adder.py](Code%20Files/Ex__2_40_digit_adder.py) for the adder code.

See the file [Ex__2_test_40_digit_adder.py](Code%20Files/Ex__2_test_40_digit_adder.py) for the test code.

To execute the tests, assuming **Python** is installed and is in your path, execute the command `python Ex__2_test_40_digit_adder.py`

This is the output of a test run:
```
C:\>python Ex__2_test_40_digit_adder.py
