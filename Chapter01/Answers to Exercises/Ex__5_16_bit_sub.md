# Chapter 1, Exercise 5

Write 6502 assembly code to subtract two 16-bit values using an approach like [Exercise 4](Ex__4_16_bit_add.md). Test with the expressions \$0001-\$0000, \$0001-\$0001, \$0100-\$00FF, and \$0000-\$0001. What is the result for \$0000-\$0001?

# Answer
See the 6502 assembly file [Ex__5_16_bit_subtraction.asm](Code%20Files/Ex__5_16_bit_subtraction.asm) for the 16-bit subtraction code.

Try running this code at https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/

The result for \$0000-\$0001 is \$FFFF.
