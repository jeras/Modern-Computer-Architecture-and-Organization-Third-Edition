# Chapter 4: Computer System Components

This chapter introduces some of the lower-level internal components of computer systems. We begin with the **metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)** transistor, which is widely used in memory circuits and throughout virtually all modern digital devices. We examine the design of MOS transistor-based computer memory and its interface with the processor. We’ll look at modern computer **input/output (I/O)** interfaces, with a focus on the use of high-speed serial communication within the computer case, as well as the transfer of data over cable connections to and from external components. The performance requirements of system I/O devices, including the graphics display, network interface, keyboard, and mouse, will be discussed. The chapter ends with a descriptive example of the specifications for a modern computer motherboard.

After completing this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the hardware components of modern computer systems, from their technical specifications down to the circuit level. You will have learned how system memory is implemented, including the fundamentals of caching. You will understand the mechanisms of efficient I/O operations and the use of **Universal Serial Bus (USB)** to connect keyboards, mice, and other I/O devices. You will understand the computer’s network interface and will be familiar with the key technical aspects of a modern computer motherboard.
The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

* Memory subsystem 
* Introducing the MOSFET
* Constructing DRAM circuits with MOSFETs 
* I/O subsystem
* Graphics displays
* Network interface
* Keyboard and mouse
* Modern computer system specifications
