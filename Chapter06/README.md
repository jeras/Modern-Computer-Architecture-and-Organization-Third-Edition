# Chapter 6: Specialized Computing Domains

Most computer users are at least superficially familiar with key performance-related specifications of personal computers and smart digital devices, such as processor speed and **random-access memory (RAM)** size. This chapter examines the performance requirements of computing domains that are less directly visible to users, including real-time systems and digital signal processing. We will explore the unique computational features of these domains and review examples of modern devices that implement these concepts.

After completing this chapter, you will be able to identify application areas that require real-time computing and will understand the underlying concepts of digital signal processing, with an emphasis on its widespread use in computer audio and in wireless communication. You will be familiar with some modern implementations of components in the computing domains discussed in this chapter.

This chapter covers the following topics:
* Real-time computing
* Digital signal processing
* Examples of specialized architectures
