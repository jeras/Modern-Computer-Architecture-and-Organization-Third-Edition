# Chapter 7: Processor and Memory Architectures

This chapter presents a deeper examination of modern processor architectures, specifically the von Neumann, Harvard, and modified Harvard variants, as well as the computing domains in which each architecture is commonly applied. The concepts and benefits of paged virtual memory, which is employed extensively in consumer and business computing, as well as in portable smart devices, are also introduced. We will examine the practical details of memory management in the real-world context of Windows NT and later Windows versions. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the memory management unit's functions.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the key features of modern processor architectures and the attributes of physical and virtual memory. You will also understand the benefits of memory paging and the functions of the memory management unit.

This chapter covers the following topics:
* The von Neumann, Harvard, and modified Harvard architectures
* Physical and virtual memory
* Paged virtual memory
* Memory management unit
