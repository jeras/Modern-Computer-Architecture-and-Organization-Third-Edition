# Answer
Section 13.4.1.4.1 of the reference manual describes the processor power management subsystem. Some key features are:
* Separate power domains for the processor, memory, and other subsystems.
* Integrated secondary power supplies that independently support powering a variety of subsystems.
* Voltage and clock frequency control enabling **dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)**.
* Temperature sensors.
* Voltage sensors.
