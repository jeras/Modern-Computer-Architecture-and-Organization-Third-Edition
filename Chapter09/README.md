# Chapter 9: Specialized Processor Extensions

In the preceding chapters, we discussed the features of general-purpose computer architectures and some architectural specializations intended to address domain-specific requirements and performance needs. This chapter focuses on extensions commonly implemented at the processor instruction set level and in other computer system hardware to provide additional system capabilities beyond generic computing.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the purpose of privileged processor modes and how they operate in multiprocessing and multiuser contexts. You will be familiar with the concepts of floating-point processing units and instruction sets, power management in battery-powered devices, and processor and system features that enhance system security.

We will discuss the following specialized extensions in this chapter:

* Privileged processor modes
* Floating-point mathematics
* Power management
* System security management

# Chapter Files
[integer_division.cpp](Chapter%20Files/integer_division.cpp) is an example of integer division in C++.

On Linux the source code can be compiled using the command line:
```Bash
g++ integer_division.cpp -o integer_division
```
And the generated executable `integer_division` can be run with:
```Bash
./integer_division
```
