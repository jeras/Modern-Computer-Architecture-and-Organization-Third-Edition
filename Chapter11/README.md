# Chapter 11: Modern Processor Architectures and Instruction Sets

Most modern personal computers contain a processor supporting either the Intel or AMD
version of the x86 32-bit and x64 64-bit architectures. Almost all smartphones, smart
watches, tablets, and many embedded systems, on the other hand, contain ARM 32-bit
or 64-bit processors. This chapter takes a detailed look at the registers and instruction
sets of all of these processor families.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the top-level architectures and unique
attributes of the x86, x64, 32-bit ARM, and 64-bit ARM registers, instruction sets,
assembly languages, and key aspects of legacy feature support in these architectures.

This chapter covers the following topics:
* x86 architecture and instruction set
* x64 architecture and instruction set
* 32-bit ARM architecture and instruction set
* 64-bit ARM architecture and instruction set

# Chapter Files
[hello_x86.asm](Chapter%20Files/hello_x86.asm) is the 32-bit x86 **hello** assembly language program.

[hello_x64.asm](Chapter%20Files/hello_x64.asm) is the 64-bit x64 **hello** assembly language program.

[hello_arm.S](Chapter%20Files/hello_arm.S) is the 32-bit ARM **hello** assembly language program.

[hello_arm64.S](Chapter%20Files/hello_arm64.S) is the 64-bit ARM **hello** assembly language program.
