# Chapter 13: Processor Virtualization

This chapter introduces the concepts underlying processor virtualization and explores the
many benefits to individual users and large organizations that are achievable through the
effective use of virtualization. We will discuss the principal virtualization techniques and the open
source and commercial tools that implement them.

Virtualization tools enable the emulation of instruction set–accurate representations of
various computer architectures and operating systems on general-purpose computers.
Virtualization is used widely in the deployment of real-world software applications in
cloud environments.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the technology and benefits associated
with hardware virtualization and how modern processors support virtualization at
the instruction set level. You will have learned the technical features of several open
source and commercial tools providing virtualization capabilities and will understand
how virtualization is used to build and deploy scalable applications in cloud computing
environments.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:
* Introducing virtualization
* Virtualization challenges
* Virtualizing modern processors
* Virtualization tools
* Virtualization and cloud computing
