# Chapter 14: Domain-Specific Computer Architectures

This chapter brings together many of the topics discussed in previous chapters as we examine a variety of computer system architectures designed to meet unique user requirements in different domains. We will gain an understanding of the user-level requirements and performance capabilities associated with several categories of real-world computer systems.

This chapter covers the following topics:
* Architecting computer systems to meet unique requirements
* Smartphone architecture
* Personal computer architecture
* Warehouse-scale computing architecture
* Neural networks and machine learning architectures

After completing this chapter, you will understand some key drivers of the decision process that system designers apply when developing computer architectures to support specific needs. You will be familiar with the key requirements propelling the designs of mobile devices, personal computers, cloud server environments, and machine learning systems.
