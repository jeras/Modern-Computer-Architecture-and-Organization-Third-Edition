# Chapter 16, Exercise 1

Where supported, set up two-factor authentication for all your internet-accessible accounts that contain data you care about. This includes bank accounts, email accounts, social media, code repositories (if you are a software developer), medical services, and anything else you value. Ensure that at all stages you use only information and software applications from trusted sources.

# Answer
A comprehensive list of websites and their support (or non-support) for two-factor authentication is available at **2FA Directory** (https://2fa.directory/). 2FA is an abbreviation for two-factor authentication.

A standard method for implementing two-factor authentication is for the site to send an SMS text containing a code to the phone number associated with the account after the user enters a valid username and password. 

The code is typically a 6-digit number that the user must enter on the website to complete the login process. The two factors used for authentication are the user’s knowledge of the account password and the demonstrated access to the phone associated with the account.

Some sites support an app such as the **Microsoft Authenticator app** (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/about-microsoft-authenticator-9783c865-0308-42fb-a519-8cf666fe0acc) for two-factor authentication. When accessing a site that uses the app, after entering your username and password, a notification may appear on your phone. With a single tap, you can approve access and complete the login. For sites that do not send notifications, a numeric code will be available in the app for you to enter on the site, just like the SMS text code.
