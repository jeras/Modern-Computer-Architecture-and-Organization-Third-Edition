# Chapter 16, Exercise 2

Create strong passwords for all your internet-accessible accounts containing information of value that cannot be protected by two-factor authentication. A strong password is long (15 characters or more) and includes uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters (for example: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * +). To keep track of these complex passwords, install and use a reputable password manager. Use care when selecting a password manager and consider its source.

# Answer
There are many options for securely storing passwords for use on your computer and other devices. Most web browsers and antivirus software packages offer password management. Standalone password manager applications are also available. You can narrow your choices by searching for password managers online.

When a site asks you to set a password, you can have the password manager generate a long, random-looking string of characters as your new password. You won’t need to remember the password because it will be stored securely by the password manager.

When selecting a password management solution, consider whether you need to maintain current passwords across all your devices. When you change a site's password, you don't want to have to update it in multiple places. A browser-based password manager such as **Firefox** (https://www.firefox.com/en-US) will take care of this for you, as long as you have created a Firefox account and logged in on each device.
