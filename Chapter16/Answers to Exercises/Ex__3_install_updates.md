# Chapter 16, Exercise 3

Update the operating system and other applications and services (such as Java) on all computers and other devices under your control. This will ensure the security updates included in those updates start protecting you soon after they become available. Develop a plan to continue installing updates regularly as they are released, ensuring you remain protected in the future. Where possible, configure trusted applications and services to install security updates automatically as they become available.

# Answer
1.	Go into the update settings for each device and see whether any updates are awaiting installation. If they are, install them.
2.	If no updates are waiting, have the device check for updates and install any that appear.
3.	Start each application you use and rely on, and have it check for updates. Install any that are available.
4.	If an application has an option to check for updates, ensure it is turned on automatically. You may want to be notified when updates are available, but not have them installed automatically.
5.	Set a recurring reminder in your calendar to check for updates on all devices and applications at the shortest reasonable interval—whether weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Don’t wait too long between installing updates: your system remains vulnerable from the moment a security flaw is discovered until the update that fixes it is applied.
