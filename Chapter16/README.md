# Chapter 16: Cybersecurity and Confidential Computing Architectures

This chapter explores computing architectures built to meet the demanding security requirements of critical applications—ranging from national security systems to financial transaction processing—where vulnerabilities can have severe consequences. These systems must be resilient against a broad range of cybersecurity threats, including malicious code, covert channel attacks, and attacks facilitated by physical access to computing hardware. Topics addressed in this chapter include cybersecurity threats, encryption, digital signatures, and secure hardware and software design.

After completing this chapter, you will be able to identify the categories of cybersecurity threats a system may face and understand the security features of modern computer hardware. You will understand how to avoid security gaps in system design and how a secure computer architecture can help enforce security in software applications.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:
* Cybersecurity threats
* Features of secure hardware
* Confidential computing
* Designing for security at the architectural level
* Ensuring security in system and application software
