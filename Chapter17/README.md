# Chapter 17: Blockchain and Bitcoin Mining Architectures

This chapter begins with a brief introduction to the concepts associated with blockchain, a public, cryptographically secured ledger recording a sequence of transactions. We continue with an overview of Bitcoin mining, which appends transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and rewards miners who complete this task with Bitcoin. Bitcoin processing requires high-performance computing hardware, as illustrated by the architecture of a current-generation Bitcoin mining computer. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction to some cryptocurrency alternatives to Bitcoin.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain and how this technology is applied. You will have learned the steps involved in the Bitcoin mining process and will understand the key features of Bitcoin mining hardware architectures. You will be familiar with the characteristics of several popular cryptocurrencies.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:
* Introduction to blockchain and Bitcoin
* The Bitcoin mining process
* Bitcoin mining computer architecture
* Alternative cryptocurrencies
