# Chapter 18, Exercise 1

If you do not already have Python installed on your computer, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the current version. Ensure Python is in your search path by typing `python –-version` at a Windows command prompt. You should receive a response similar to `Python 3.13.7`. 

Install TensorFlow (an open source platform for machine learning) with the command (also at the system command prompt) `pip install tensorflow`. You may need to use the _Run as administrator_ option when opening the command prompt to ensure a successful installation. Install Matplotlib (a library for visualizing data) with the command `pip install matplotlib`.


# Answer
See the Windows batch file [Ex__1_install_tensorflow.bat](Code%20Files/Ex__1_install_tensorflow.bat) for the commands to install TensorFlow and Matplotlib.

To run the batch file, assuming **Python** is installed and is in your path, open an *Administrator* command prompt and execute the command `Ex__1_install_tensorflow.bat`
