# Chapter 18: Self-Driving Vehicle Architectures

In this chapter, we explore the processing architectures and computational capabilities of self-navigating vehicles. The chapter begins by examining the sensors that self-driving vehicles rely on during operation and the types of data each provides. We continue with a review of the requirements for ensuring the safety of the autonomous vehicle and its occupants, as well as that of other vehicles, pedestrians, and stationary objects. Next, we examine the types of processing required for effective vehicle control. The chapter concludes with an overview of an example self-driving vehicle computer architecture.

After completing this chapter, you will be familiar with the computing architectures used by self-driving vehicles. You will understand the types of sensors and input data used by these vehicles. You will be able to describe the types of processing required by self-driving vehicles and will understand the safety issues associated with their operation.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:
* Overview of self-driving vehicles
* Safety concerns of self-driving vehicles
* Hardware and software requirements for self-driving vehicles
* Autonomous vehicle computing architecture
