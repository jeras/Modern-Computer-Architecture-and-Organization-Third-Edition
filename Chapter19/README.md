# Chapter 19: Quantum Computing and Other Future Directions in Computer Architectures

This chapter looks ahead to the future of computer architecture. We begin with a review of the significant technological advances and ongoing trends that have led to the current state of the art. We extrapolate current trends and highlight some directions that computing system designs are likely to take in the coming years. We will examine some potentially disruptive technologies that could alter the evolution of computer systems.

This chapter also outlines strategies to enhance the professional development of computer architects. By following these recommendations, you should be able to maintain a skill set that remains relevant and adaptable to future advances, whatever they may be.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the historical evolution of computer architecture that led to its current state and will be familiar with ongoing trends in computer design and their likely impact on future technological directions. You will be aware of some potentially disruptive technologies that could significantly alter future computer architectures. You will also have learned valuable techniques for maintaining an ongoing, up-to-date skill set in computer architecture.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:
* The ongoing evolution of computer architecture
* Extrapolating current trends
* Potentially disruptive technologies
* Building a future-tolerant skill set
